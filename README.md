# Multi-Agent AI Systems with OpenAI Services

Welcome to the repository for showcasing examples of multi-agent AI systems developed using Python and integrated with OpenAI services. This project aims to demonstrate the power and flexibility of OpenAI's APIs in creating intelligent and collaborative agent-based systems. These examples are part of the session at REACTOR SÃO PAULO, during the week of sessions for the Global AI Bootcamp 2025. https://globalai.community/bootcamp/

Session at Reactor São Paulo: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/25121/

## Project Overview

This repository contains various examples that illustrate how to build multi-agent systems using Python and harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI services. Each example demonstrates different strategies and applications, from simple coordination tasks to complex problem-solving scenarios.

The initial four examples are based on design patterns for agentic systems, as discussed in https://github.com/microsoft/azure-genai-design-patterns

Four common design patterns are presented:
- RAG agent
- Code Generation Agent
- Multi-Agent System
- Multi-Domain Agent System

## Features

For every design pattern, we are exploring aspects from agentic system, such as:
- **Agent Communication**: Examples of how agents can communicate and collaborate on tasks.
- **Decision Making**: Implementations showing decision-making processes in a multi-agent environment.
- **Integration with OpenAI**: Demonstrations of how to integrate OpenAI services such as GPT, Codex, and DALL-E to enhance agent capabilities.
- **Scalable Architectures**: Guides on building scalable multi-agent systems.

## Installation

To get started with these examples, you will need to install some prerequisites and set up your environment.
