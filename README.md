# Multi-Agent AI Systems with OpenAI Services

Welcome to the repository for showcasing examples of multi-agent AI systems developed using Python and integrated with OpenAI services. This project aims to demonstrate the power and flexibility of OpenAI's APIs in creating intelligent and collaborative agent-based systems.
These examples are part of the session at REACTOR SÃO PAULO, during the week of sessions for the Global AI Bootcamp 2025. https://globalai.community/bootcamp/

## Project Overview

This repository contains various examples that illustrate how to build multi-agent systems using Python and harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI services. Each example demonstrates different strategies and applications, from simple coordination tasks to complex problem-solving scenarios.

## Features

- **Agent Communication**: Examples of how agents can communicate and collaborate on tasks.
- **Decision Making**: Implementations showing decision-making processes in a multi-agent environment.
- **Integration with OpenAI**: Demonstrations of how to integrate OpenAI services such as GPT, Codex, and DALL-E to enhance agent capabilities.
- **Scalable Architectures**: Guides on building scalable multi-agent systems.

## Installation
